# SMI_telebotproj

First telegram bot project - done within 72 hours for my National Service SCS Recon Camp.

Project uses LocalDB - SQLite to store data of "regulars" in the camp

Daily attendance is then logged onto an excel file and DB, which can be used to generate a parade state.

Parade state - Statuses of everyone in camp. Strength of the camp and reasons for not being in camp. ( Used for attendance taking ) 

Excel sheet can show attendance of each person in camp throughout 3 months - can be copied and pasted into google sheets which is used by the superiors to track individual soldier's performance.

#PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED
